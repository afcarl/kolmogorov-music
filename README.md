Kolmogorov music
================

Abstract
--------

Kolmogorov complexity analysis suggests that we can measure how well we
understand a piece of music by the concision of a program that produces it.

Furthermore, the inherent complexity of a groove and a fugue can be compared
via the lengths of their programmatic representations, and their relationship
can be described as a program transformation.

Algorithmic composition has curious implications for the creation, copyright
and performance of pieces, both finite and infinite. Expect \(finite\)
demonstrations.
